    "Decision tree classification is a machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to make predictions based on the features of the data. The algorithm works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of the features, until a stopping criterion is met. The goal is to create a tree that maximizes the separation between the classes of the target variable. The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification can be explained in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the impurity of the target variable: The first step in building a decision tree is to calculate the impurity of the target variable, which is a measure of how mixed the classes are in the data. A common impurity measure for classification is the Gini impurity, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini Impurity = 1 - âˆ‘(pi)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "where pi is the proportion of instances in the data that belong to class i. If all instances in the data belong to the same class, the Gini impurity is 0, and if the classes are equally mixed, the Gini impurity is 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the impurity reduction of a feature: The next step is to calculate the impurity reduction of each feature, which is a measure of how much the separation between the classes improves when the data is split based on that feature. The impurity reduction is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Impurity Reduction = Gini Impurity before split - weighted average of Gini Impurity after split\n",

    "where the weighted average is taken over the subsets of data created by the split, and the weights are proportional to the number of instances in each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose the feature with the highest impurity reduction: The feature with the highest impurity reduction is selected as the splitting criterion for the next node of the tree. This process is repeated recursively for each subset of data until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stopping criterion: The stopping criterion for the decision tree can be based on several factors, such as the maximum depth of the tree, the minimum number of instances in a leaf node, or the minimum impurity reduction of a split.\n",

The resulting regions form a partition of the feature space, where each region corresponds to a leaf node in the tree, and is assigned a class label based on the majority class of the training instances in that region.\n",
