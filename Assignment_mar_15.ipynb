    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI can be applied in various domains such as speech recognition, natural language processing, image and video analysis, robotics, and decision-making systems.\n",

    "2) Machine learning (ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A typical example of machine learning is a spam filter, which can learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails based on a set of labeled examples. As it receives more data, the algorithm becomes better at recognizing patterns and making accurate predictions.\n",

    "3) Deep learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a type of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks, which are composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes. It involves training complex models that can learn hierarchical representations of data and perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n",

    "Example: A popular example of deep learning is image recognition, where a deep neural network can learn to classify images into different categories such as dogs, cats, or cars based on millions of labeled examples. Another example is speech recognition, where deep neural networks can learn to transcribe spoken words into text with high accuracy."
