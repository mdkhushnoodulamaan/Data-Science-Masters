    "Ordinal encoding involves assigning each unique category in a categorical variable a numerical value based on the order or rank of that category. For example, in a variable with the categories \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high,\" we might assign the values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This technique is useful when there is a natural order to the categories.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that involves encoding categorical variables based on the target variable, rather than just the categories themselves. This technique can be useful when we have a categorical variable with many categories and we want to capture the relationship between the categories and the target variable in a more meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea behind Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is to replace each category with a number that reflects the relationship between that category and the target variable. For example, if we have a binary target variable and a categorical variable with three categories, we might calculate the mean of the target variable for each category, and then assign each category a number based on its mean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step process for performing Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Group the categorical variable by its unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Calculate the mean of the target variable for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Sort the groups by their mean target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Assign each group a unique integer value based on its rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset with a categorical variable called \"city\" and a binary target variable called \"is_fraud.\" We can perform Target Guided Ordinal Encoding on the \"city\" variable as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Group the dataset by the unique values of \"city\": New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Calculate the mean of \"is_fraud\" for each group:\n",

    "Los Angeles: 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago: 0.02\n",
    "\n",
    "Houston: 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Sort the groups by their mean target value:\n",
    "\n",
    "4) New York\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Los Angeles\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Chicago\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Houston\n",

    "\n",
    "Chicago: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Houston: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we've assigned a higher value to cities with a higher mean rate of fraud, so the encoding reflects the relationship between the \"city\" variable and the target variable in a meaningful way"

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. Specifically, it measures how much two variables change together: when one variable increases, does the other variable tend to increase or decrease as well?

If two variables have a high positive covariance, we can infer that they are strongly related and tend to increase or decrease together.
