    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the features of both Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression. Like Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression can perform variable selection and shrink the coefficients of irrelevant variables to zero, resulting in a sparse model. Like Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression can handle correlated predictors and prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients towards each other.\n",

    "The main advantage of Elastic Net Regression over Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression is that it can handle situations where there are many correlated predictors and where some of the predictors are irrelevant. In such situations, Lasso Regression may select only one of the correlated variables randomly, and Ridge Regression may not perform feature selection. Elastic Net Regression can strike a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage, leading to a more stable and reliable model.\n"
