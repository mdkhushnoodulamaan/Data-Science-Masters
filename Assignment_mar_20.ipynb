For instance, we can assign 1 to month-to-month, 2 to one-year, and 3 to two-year. This will introduce a hierarchy among the categories, where two-year is higher than one-year, and one-year is higher than month-to-month. However, this hierarchy may not be meaningful or relevant in this case, as the three contract types do not necessarily have a natural ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use nominal encoding, also known as one-hot encoding. Nominal encoding involves creating a binary column for each unique category in the contract type column. In this case, we will create three binary columns, one for each unique category: month-to-month, one-year, and two-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement nominal encoding, we can use pandas' get_dummies() function. This function takes the categorical feature as input and returns a new dataframe with binary columns for each unique category. We can then concatenate this new dataframe with the original dataframe to obtain a new dataframe with both numerical and binary columns."
