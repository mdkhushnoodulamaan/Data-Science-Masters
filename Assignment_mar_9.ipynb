    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used in probability theory to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF is used for discrete random variables, where the random variable can only take on a finite or countably infinite number of values. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value.\n",

    "For example, let's consider the random variable X representing the outcome of a fair six-sided die roll. The PMF of X is:\n",

    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",

    "This PMF tells us that the probability of getting any specific value on the die is 1/6.\n",

    "PDF, on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables, where the random variable can take on any value within a certain range. It gives the probability density of the random variable at a given point.\n",

    "For example, let's consider the random variable Y representing the height of students in a class. The PDF of Y might look like a bell curve, with the highest density of students around the average height.\n",

    "The PDF of Y can be represented mathematically as:\n",

    "f(y) = (1/σ√(2π)) * e^(-(y-μ)²/2σ²)\n",

    "where μ is the mean height, σ is the standard deviation, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF gives us the probability density of a student being a certain height. The total probability of a student being within a certain range of heights can be calculated by integrating the PDF over that range."
