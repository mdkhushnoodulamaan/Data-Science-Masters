    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a measure of how well the model fits the data, and it ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",
    "\n",
    "where SSres is the sum of squared residuals, and SStot is the total sum of squares. The sum of squared residuals is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the predicted values from the model. The total sum of squares is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared can be interpreted as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. A value of 1 indicates that the model explains all of the variance in the dependent variable, while a value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, R-squared values between 0.5 and 0.9 are considered to be good, but the interpretation of R-squared depends on the specific context of the problem and the field of study. It is important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is a good fit for the data, and it is possible to have a model with a low R-squared value that is still useful for making predictions.\n",

    "In summary, R-squared is a measure of how well the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model explain the variance in the dependent variable. It is calculated as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model and ranges from 0 to 1."

    "\n",
    "1. Easy to understand: These metrics are easy to understand and interpret. They provide a clear measure of the accuracy of the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Widely used: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are widely used evaluation metrics for regression models. This means that they can be used to compare the performance of different models and are often reported in research papers.\n",

    "3. Sensitivity to outliers: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are sensitive to outliers in the data. This means that they can identify large errors in the predictions and provide a more realistic measure of the model's accuracy.\n",

    "Disadvantages of RMSE, MSE, and MAE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can be influenced by scale: These metrics can be influenced by the scale of the data. This means that if the scale of the dependent variable is large, the RMSE, MSE, and MAE values will also be large, making it difficult to compare the performance of different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. May not capture all aspects of the model: RMSE, MSE, and MAE only capture the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable. They do not capture other aspects of the model, such as the significance of the independent variables or the model's ability to capture the underlying relationships in the data.\n",

    "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models. It works by adding a penalty term to the cost function of the model, which forces the model to shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero.\n",
